    "text": "Computer Science Enthusiast\nDriven by a passion for innovation and problem-solving, I am a dedicated computer science student with a keen interest in exploring the intersection of technology, creativity, and real-world impact. Currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science at University of Toronto, I am deeply immersed in coursework covering a wide array of topics, including algorithms, data structures, software engineering, and machine learning. Beyond the classroom, I actively engage in projects that challenge me to apply theoretical concepts to practical solutions, whether itâ€™s developing innovative software applications, participating in coding competitions, or contributing to open-source initiatives. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++, I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and stay abreast of emerging technologies. Committed to lifelong learning and collaboration, I am excited about the endless possibilities that the field of computer science offers and eager to make meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving tech landscape."
